The books are not meant for children, but for adults who enjoy satire, irony, and nostalgia. They poke fun at the innocence and morality of the original stories, and expose the absurdity and hypocrisy of modern society. Some of the titles include *The Little Engine That Could (But Didn't Because He Had Anxiety)*, *The Poky Little Puppy Gets Euthanized*, and *Martine Goes to Rehab*.
 
Tonkato's books have attracted a cult following online, especially on social media platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and Instagram. Fans share photos of the books, create memes, and write reviews. Some celebrities have also endorsed the books, such as comedian Amy Schumer, who posted a picture of *Martine Gets an Abortion* on her Instagram account.
 
Tonkato has remained anonymous, despite the popularity and controversy of his or her books. The author has never given an interview, revealed his or her identity, or explained the motivation behind the books. Some speculate that Tonkato is a disgruntled former children's book writer, a bored graphic designer, or a prankster with a twisted sense of humor.
 
Whatever the case may be, Tonkato has succeeded in creating a unique and provocative genre of literature that challenges the norms and expectations of children's books. His or her books are not for everyone, but they are certainly unforgettable.
  
One of the most popular and controversial books by Tonkato is *Martine Goes to Rehab*, which is a parody of the classic French children's series *Martine* by Gilbert Delahaye and Marcel Marlier. The original series features a cheerful and adventurous girl named Martine, who enjoys various activities such as going to the farm, the circus, the zoo, and the mountains. The series has been translated into many languages and has sold over 100 million copies worldwide[^1^].
 
Tonkato's version, however, depicts Martine as a drug-addicted and depressed teenager, who is forced to go to a rehab center after overdosing on heroin. The book mocks the naive and wholesome tone of the original series, and shows Martine's struggles with withdrawal symptoms, therapy sessions, and fellow addicts. The book also makes references to other famous children's characters, such as Harry Potter, Winnie the Pooh, and Dora the Explorer, who are also portrayed as drug users.
 
The book has received mixed reactions from readers and critics. Some have praised Tonkato's creativity and wit, and have found the book hilarious and refreshing. Others have condemned Tonkato's disrespect and insensitivity, and have found the book offensive and disturbing. Some fans of the original series have also expressed their disappointment and anger at Tonkato's mockery of their childhood memories.
 
Tonkato has not responded to any of the criticism or praise, and has continued to publish more books in his or her unusual children's books series. Some of the latest titles include *The Little Engine That Could (But Didn't Because He Had Anxiety)*, *The Poky Little Puppy Gets Euthanized*, and *The Very Hungry Caterpillar Gets Diabetes*. Whether Tonkato is a genius or a jerk, one thing is certain: he or she knows how to make a hit with unusual children's books.
